New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------

Ability to specify per-logger log levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to specify different logging levels for different loggers on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --log-level WARN --log-level talker:=DEBUG

The above command sets a global log level of WARN, but sets the log level of the talker node messages to DEBUG.
The ``--log-level`` command-line option can be passed an arbitrary number of times to set different log levels for each logger.


Changes since the Foxy release
------------------------------

tf2_ros Python split out of tf2_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python code that used to live in tf2_ros has been moved into its own package named tf2_ros_py.
Any existing Python code that depends on tf2_ros will continue to work, but the package.xml of those packages should be amended to ``exec_depend`` on tf2_ros_py.

rclcpp
^^^^^^

Change in spin_until_future_complete template parameters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The first template parameter of ``Executor::spin_until_future_complete`` was the future result type ``ResultT``, and the method only accepted a ``std::shared_future<ResultT>``.
In order to accept other types of futures (e.g.: ``std::future``), that parameter was changed to the future type itself.

In places where a ``spin_until_future_complete`` call was relying on template argument deduction, no change is needed.
If not, this is an example diff:

.. code-block:: dpatch

   std::shared_future<MyResultT> future;
   ...
   -executor.spin_until_future_complete<MyResultT>(future);
   +executor.spin_until_future_complete<std::shared_future<MyResultT>>(future);


For more details, see `ros2/rclcpp#1160 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1160>`_.
For an example of the needed changes in user code, see `ros-visualization/interactive_markers#72 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/interactive_markers/pull/72>`_.

Change in default ``/clock`` subscription QoS profile
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default was changed from a reliable communication with history depth 10 to a best effort communication with history depth 1.
See `ros2/rclcpp#1312 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1312>`_.

rclcpp_action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Action client goal response callback signature changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The goal response callback should now take a shared pointer to a goal handle, instead of a future.

For `example <https://github.com/ros2/examples/pull/291>`_, old signature:

.. code-block:: c++

   void goal_response_callback(std::shared_future<GoalHandleFibonacci::SharedPtr> future)

New signature:

.. code-block:: c++

   void goal_response_callback(GoalHandleFibonacci::SharedPtr goal_handle)
