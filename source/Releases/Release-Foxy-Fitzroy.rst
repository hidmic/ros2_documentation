New features in this ROS 2 release
----------------------------------

During the development the `Foxy meta-ticket <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/830>`__ on GitHub contains an up-to-date state of the ongoing high level tasks as well as references specific tickets with more details.

Changes since the Eloquent release
----------------------------------

Default working directory for ament_add_test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default working directory for tests added with ``ament_add_test`` has been changed to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` to match the behavior of CMake ``add_test``.
Either update the tests to work with the new default or pass ``WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}`` to restore the previous value.

Default Console Logging Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default console logging output format was changed to include the timestamp by default, see:

- `https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/190 <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/190>`_
- `https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-logging-format/11549 <https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-logging-format/11549>`_

Default Console Logging Output Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Foxy, all logging messages at all severity levels get logged to stderr by default.
This ensures that logging messages come out immediately, and brings the ROS 2 logging system into alignment with most other logging systems.
It is possible to change the stream to stdout at runtime via the RCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT environment variable, but all logging messages will still go to the same stream.
See `https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/196 <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/196>`_ for more details.

launch_ros
^^^^^^^^^^

Node name and namespace parameters changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``Node`` action parameters related to naming have been changed:

- ``node_name`` has been renamed to ``name``
- ``node_namespace`` has been renamed to ``namespace``
- ``node_executable`` has been renamed to ``executable``
- ``exec_name`` has been added for naming the process associated with the node.
  Previously, users would have used the ``name`` keyword argument.

The old parameters have been deprecated.

These changes were made to make the launch frontend more idiomatic.
For example, instead of

.. code-block:: xml

   <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" node-name="foo" />

we can now write

.. code-block:: xml

   <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" name="foo" />

This change also applies to ``ComposableNodeContainer``, ``ComposableNode``, and ``LifecycleNode``.
For examples, see the `relevant changes to the demos. <https://github.com/ros2/demos/pull/431>`_

`Related pull request in launch_ros. <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/122>`_

rclpy
^^^^^

Support for multiple on parameter set callbacks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the ``Node`` methods ``add_on_set_parameters_callback`` and ``remove_on_set_parameters_callback`` for adding and removing functions that are called when parameters are set.

The method ``set_parameters_calblack`` has been deprecated.

rmw_connext_cpp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connext 5.1 locator kinds compatibility mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Up to and including ``Eloquent``, ``rmw_connext_cpp`` was setting ``dds.transport.use_510_compatible_locator_kinds`` property to ``true``.
This property is not being forced anymore, and shared transport communication between ``Foxy`` and previous releases will stop working.
Logs similar to:

.. code-block::

PRESParticipant_checkTransportInfoMatching:Warning: discovered remote participant 'RTI Administration Console' using the 'shmem' transport with class ID 16777216.
This class ID does not match the class ID 2 of the same transport in the local participant 'talker'.
These two participants will not communicate over the 'shmem' transport.
Check the value of the property 'dds.transport.use_510_compatible_locator_kinds' in the local participant.
See https://community.rti.com/kb/what-causes-error-discovered-remote-participant for additional info.

will be observed when this incompatibility happens.

If compatibility is needed, it can be set up in an external qos profiles files containing:

.. code-block:: xml

   <participant_qos>
      <property>
         <value>
               <element>
                  <name>
                     dds.transport.use_510_compatible_locator_kinds
                  </name>
                  <value>1</value> 
               </element>
         </value>
      </property>
   </participant_qos>

Remember to set the ``NDDS_QOS_PROFILES`` environment variable to the qos profiles file path.

Tools timestamp messages using ROS time
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

'2D Pose Estimate', '2D Nav Goal', and 'Publish Point' tools now timestamp their messages using ROS time instead of system time, in order for the ``use_sim_time`` parameter to have an effect on them.

Timeline before the release
---------------------------

A few milestones leading up to the release:

.. note::

  The coronavirus pandemic has slowed down the progress on a few very important features / improvements / bug fixes which are targeted for Foxy.
  As a consequence the following dates are subject to maximum delay of two weeks.
  You should not rely on these extra two weeks but still aim to meet the below deadlines to land any contributions to the ``ros_core`` packages.
  Once all the pull requests considered to be very important have landed the API freeze will happen right away and not wait for the full two weeks.
  Also if any of the desired changes doesn't land within the two weeks extension the freeze will happen anyway.
  The subsequent dates will likely shift by the same duration the API and feature freeze date has shifted and will be updated accordingly.

    Wed. April 8th, 2020 (potentially delayed until up to April 22nd)
        API and feature freeze for ``ros_core`` [1]_ packages.
        Note that this includes ``rmw``, which is a recursive dependency of ``ros_core``.
        Only bug fix releases should be made after this point.
        New packages can be released independently.

    Mon. April 13th, 2020 (beta) (subject to change based on shift of the API and feature freeze date)
        Updated releases of ``desktop`` [2]_ packages available.
        Testing of the new features.

    Wed. May 13th, 2020 (release candidate) (subject to change based on shift of the API and feature freeze date)
        Updated releases of ``desktop`` [2]_ packages available.

    Wed. May 20, 2020 (subject to change based on shift of the API and feature freeze date)
        Freeze rosdistro.
        No PRs for Foxy on the `rosdistro` repo will be merged (reopens after the release announcement).
