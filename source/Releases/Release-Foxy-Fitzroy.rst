New features in this ROS 2 release

Changes since the Eloquent release
----------------------------------

Default working directory for ament_add_test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default working directory for tests added with ``ament_add_test`` has been changed to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` to match the behavior of CMake ``add_test``.
Either update the tests to work with the new default or pass ``WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}`` to restore the previous value.

Default Console Logging Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default console logging output format was changed to include the timestamp by default, see:

- `https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/190 <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/190>`_
- `https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-logging-format/11549 <https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-logging-format/11549>`_

Default Console Logging Output Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Foxy, all logging messages at all severity levels get logged to stderr by default.
This ensures that logging messages come out immediately, and brings the ROS 2 logging system into alignment with most other logging systems.
It is possible to change the stream to stdout at runtime via the RCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT environment variable, but all logging messages will still go to the same stream.
See `https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/196 <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/196>`_ for more details.

launch_ros
^^^^^^^^^^

Node name and namespace parameters changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``Node`` action parameters related to naming have been changed:

- ``node_name`` has been renamed to ``name``
- ``node_namespace`` has been renamed to ``namespace``
- ``node_executable`` has been renamed to ``executable``
- ``exec_name`` has been added for naming the process associated with the node.
  Previously, users would have used the ``name`` keyword argument.

The old parameters have been deprecated.

These changes were made to make the launch frontend more idiomatic.
For example, instead of

.. code-block:: xml

   <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" node-name="foo" />

we can now write

.. code-block:: xml

   <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" name="foo" />

This change also applies to ``ComposableNodeContainer``, ``ComposableNode``, and ``LifecycleNode``.
For examples, see the `relevant changes to the demos. <https://github.com/ros2/demos/pull/431>`_

`Related pull request in launch_ros. <https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/122>`_

rclpy
^^^^^

Support for multiple on parameter set callbacks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the ``Node`` methods ``add_on_set_parameters_callback`` and ``remove_on_set_parameters_callback`` for adding and removing functions that are called when parameters are set.

The method ``set_parameters_calblack`` has been deprecated.
