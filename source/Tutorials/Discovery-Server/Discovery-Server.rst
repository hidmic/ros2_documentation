Background
----------

Starting from ROS 2 Eloquent Elusor, the **Fast DDS Discovery Server** protocol is a feature that offers a centralised dynamic discovery mechanism, as opposed to the distributed mechanism used in DDS by default.
This tutorial explains how to run some ROS 2 examples using the Fast DDS Discovery Server feature as discovery communication.

In order to get more information about the available discovery configuration, please check the `following documentation <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/discovery.html>`_ or read the `Fast DDS Discovery Server specific documentation <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/discovery_server.html#discovery-server>`__.

The `Simple Discovery Protocol <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/simple.html>`__ is the standard protocol defined in the `DDS standard <https://www.omg.org/omg-dds-portal/>`__.
However, it has known disadvantages in some scenarios.

* It does not **Scale** efficiently, as the number of exchanged packets increases significantly as new nodes are added.
* It requires **multicasting** capabilities that may not work reliably in some scenarios, e.g. WiFi.

The **Fast DDS Discovery Server** provides a Client-Server Architecture that allows nodes to connect with each other using an intermediate server.
Each node functions as a *discovery client*, sharing its info with one or more *discovery servers* and receiving discovery information from it.
This reduces discovery-related network traffic and it does not require multicasting capabilities.

These discovery servers can be independent, duplicated or connected with each other in order to create redundancy over the network and avoid having a single point of failure.

Fast DDS Discovery Server v2
----------------------------

The latest ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy release (December 2020) included a new version, version 2 of the Fast DDS Discovery Server.
This version includes a new filter feature that further reduces the number of discovery messages sent.
This version uses the topic of the different nodes to decide if two nodes wish to communicate, or if they can be left unmatched (i.e. not discovering each other).
The following figure shows the decrease in discovery messages:

.. image:: figures/ds1vs2.svg
    :align: center

This architecture reduces the number of messages sent between the server and clients dramatically.
In the following graph, the reduction in network traffic over the discovery phase for the `RMF Clinic demonstration <https://github.com/osrf/rmf_demos#Clinic-World>`__ is shown:

.. image:: figures/discovery_server_v2_performance.svg
    :align: center


In order to use this functionality, the discovery server can be configured using the `XML configuration for Participants <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/discovery_server.html#discovery-server>`__.
It is also possible to configure the discovery server using the ``fastdds`` `tool <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastddscli/cli/cli.html#discovery>`__ and an `environment variable <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/env_vars/env_vars.html>`__, which is the approach used in this tutorial.
For a more detailed explanation about the configuration of the discovery server, visit `the Fast DDS Discovery Server documentation <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/discovery_server.html#discovery-server>`__.


Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial assumes you have a ROS 2 Foxy (or newer) :ref:`installation <InstallationGuide>`.
If your installation is using a ROS 2 version lower than Foxy, you cannot use the ``fastdds`` tool.
Thus, in order to use the Discovery Server, you can update your repository to use a different Fast DDS version, or configure the discovery server using the `Fast DDS XML QoS configuration <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/discovery/discovery_server.html#discovery-server>`__.


Run this tutorial
-----------------

The ``talker-listener`` ROS 2 demo creates a ``talker`` node that publishes a "hello world" message every second, and a ``listener`` node that listens to these messages.

By :ref:`sourcing ROS 2 <ConfigROS2>` you will get access to the CLI tool ``fastdds``.
This tool gives access to the `discovery tool <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastddscli/cli/cli.html#discovery>`__, which can be used to launch a discovery server. This server will manage the discovery process for the nodes that connect to it.

.. important::

    Do not forget to :ref:`source ROS 2 <ConfigROS2>` in every new terminal opened.


Setup Discovery Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by launching a discovery server with id 0, port 11811 (default port) and listening on all available interfaces.

Open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 0


Launch listener node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute the listener demo, to listen to the ``/chatter`` topic.

In a new terminal, set the environment variable ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` to the location of the discovery server.
(Do not forget to source ROS 2 in every new terminal)

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=127.0.0.1:11811

Launch the listener node. Use the argument ``--remap __node:=listener_discovery_server`` to change the node's name for this tutorial.

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener_discovery_server

This will create a ROS 2 node, that will automatically create a client for the discovery server and connect to the server created previously to perform discovery, rather than using multicast.


Launch talker node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a new terminal and set the ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` environment variable as before so that the node starts a discovery client.

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=127.0.0.1:11811
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker_discovery_server

You should now see the talker publishing "hello world" messages, and the listener receiving these messages.


Demonstrate Discovery Server execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far, there is no evidence that this example and the standard talker-listener example are running differently.
To clearly demonstrate this, run another node that is not connected to the discovery server.
Run a new listener (listening in ``/chatter`` topic by default) in a new terminal and check that it is not connected to the talker already running.

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=simple_listener

The new listener node should not be receiving the "hello world" messages.

To finally verify that everything is running correctly, a new talker can be created using the simple discovery protocol (the default DDS distributed discovery mechanism) for discovery.

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=simple_talker

Now you should see the ``simple_listener`` node receiving the "hello world" messages from ``simple_talker`` but not the other messages from ``talker_discovery_server``.


Advance use cases
-----------------

The following sections show different features of the discovery server that allow you to build a robust discovery server over the network.

Server Redundancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By using ``fastdds`` tool, multiple discovery servers can be created.
Discovery clients (ROS nodes) can connect to as many servers as desired.
This allows to have a redundant network that will work even if some servers or nodes shut down unexpectedly.
The figure below shows a simple architecture that provides server redundancy.

.. image:: figures/ds_redundancy_example.svg
    :align: center

In several terminals, run the following code to establish a communication with redundant servers.

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 0 --ip-address 127.0.0.1 --port 11811

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 1 --ip-address 127.0.0.1 --port 11888

``--server-id N`` means server with id N. When referencing the servers with ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER``, server ``0`` must be in first place and server ``1`` in second place.

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811;127.0.0.1:11888"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811;127.0.0.1:11888"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener

Now, if one of these servers fails, there will still be discovery capability available and nodes will still discover each other.


Backup Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Fast DDS Discovery Server allows creating a server with backup functionality.
This allows the server to restore the last state it saved in case of a shutdown.

.. image:: figures/ds_backup_example.svg
    :align: center

In different terminals, run the following code to establish a communication with a backed-up server.

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 0 --ip-address 127.0.0.1 --port 11811 --backup

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener

Several backup files are created in the discovery server's working directory (the directory it was launched in).
The two ``SQLite`` files and two ``json`` files contain the information required to start a new server and restore the failed server's state in case of failure, avoiding the need for the discovery process to happen again, and without losing information.


Discovery partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Communication with discovery servers can be split to create virtual partitions in the discovery information.
This means that two endpoints will only know about each other if there is a shared discovery server or a network of discovery servers between them.
We are going to execute an example with two independent servers.
The following figure shows the architecture.

.. image:: figures/ds_partition_example.svg
    :align: center

With this schema ``Listener 1`` will be connected to ``Talker 1`` and ``Talker 2``, as they share ``Server 1``.
``Listener 2`` will connect with ``Talker 1`` as they share ``Server 2``.
But ``Listener 2`` will not hear the messages from ``Talker 2`` because they do not share any discovery server or discovery servers, including indirectly via connections between redundant discovery servers.

Run the first server listening on localhost with the default port of 11811.

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 0 --ip-address 127.0.0.1 --port 11811

In another terminal run the second server listening on localhost using another port, in this case port 11888.

.. code-block:: console

    fastdds discovery --server-id 1 --ip-address 127.0.0.1 --port 11888

Now, run each node in a different terminal. Use ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` environment variable to decide which server they are connected to. Be aware that the `ids must match <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.1.0/fastdds/env_vars/env_vars.html>`__.

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811;127.0.0.1:11888"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker_1

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811;127.0.0.1:11888"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener_1

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker_2

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=";127.0.0.1:11888"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener_2

We should see how ``Listener 1`` is receiving messages from both talker nodes, while ``Listener 2`` is in a different partition from ``Talker 2`` and so does not receive messages from it.

.. note::

    Once two endpoints (ROS nodes) have discovered each other, they do not need the discovery server network between them to listen to each other's messages.



ROS 2 Introspection
-------------------

ROS 2 Command Line Interface (CLI) implements several introspection tools to analyze the behaviour of a ROS2 network.
These tools (i.e. ``ros2 bag record``, ``ros2 topic list``, etc.) are very helpful to understand a ROS 2 working network.

Most of these tools use DDS simple discovery to exchange topic information with every existing participant (using simple discovery, every participant in the network is connected with each other).
However, the new Discovery Server v2 implements a network traffic reduction scheme that limits the discovery data between participants that do not share a topic.
This means that not every node will receive every topic's discovery data unless it has a reader for that topic.
As most ROS 2 CLIs need a node in the network (some of them rely on a running ROS 2 daemon, and some create their own nodes), using the Discovery Server v2 these nodes will not have all the network information, and thus their functionalities are limited.

The Discovery Server v2 functionality allows every Participant running as a **Server** (a kind of *Participant type*) to know and share all the participants and topics information with every other server matched.
In this sense, a server can be configured alongside ROS 2 introspection, since then the introspection tool will be able to discover every entity in the network that is using the Discovery Server protocol.

.. note::

    In this section we use the term *Participant* as a DDS entity. Each DDS *Participant* corresponds with a ROS 2 *Context*, a ROS 2 abstraction over DDS.
    `Nodes <ROS2Nodes>` are ROS 2 entities: ``publisher``, ``subscription``, ``service``, etc. that relies on DDS communication interfaces: ``DataWriter`` and ``DataReader``.
    Each *Participant* can hold multiple ROS 2 Nodes.
    For further details about these concepts, please visit the `ROS 2 Design web page <http://design.ros2.org/articles/Node_to_Participant_mapping.html>`__


Daemon's related tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ROS 2 Daemon is used in several ROS 2 CLI introspection tools.
It creates it's own Participant to add a ROS 2 Node to the network, in order to receive all the data sent.
This section will explain how to use ROS 2 CLI with ROS 2 Daemon running as a **Server**.
This will allow the Daemon to know all the Node's graph and to receive every topic and endpoint information.

We can use the Fast DDS XML configuration to configure the ROS 2 daemon as a Discovery Server.
Below you can find an XML configuration file which will configure every new participant as a Discovery Server.
It is important to notice that, in order to create a Discovery Server, port and GUID (id) must be specified.
Thus only one participant at a time can be created with this configuration file.
Creating more than one participant with the same file will lead to an error.

* :download:`XML Discovery Server configuration file <scripts/discovery_server_configuration_file.xml>`

First of all, instantiate a ROS 2 Daemon using this configuration (remember to source ROS 2 installation in every new terminal).

.. code-block:: console

    export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=discovery_server_configuration_file.xml
    ros2 daemon stop
    ros2 daemon start

Run a talker and a listener that will discover each other by the Server/Daemon (notice that ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` configuration is the same as the one in ``discovery_server_configuration_file.xml``).

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker

Now the Daemon can be used to introspect the network (``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` must be exported because new participants are created by these tools' executions).

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 topic list
    ros2 node info /talker
    ros2 topic info /chatter
    ros2 topic echo /chatter

Be careful to use a different terminal than that of the Daemon for each execution, as some of the introspection tools instantiate their own participants, and only one participant can be instantiated with ``discovery_server_configuration_file.xml`` exported.

We can also see the Node's Graph using the ROS 2 tool ``rqt_graph`` as follows.

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    rqt_graph


No Daemon tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some ROS 2 CLI tools do not use the ROS 2 Daemon.
In order for these tools to connect with a Discovery Server and receive all the topics information they need to be instantiated as a Server different than the main one, because they are volatile nodes.

We can configure a Discovery Server that is connected to the main Server using a configuration file similar to the one in the previous section.

* :download:`XML Secondary Discovery Server configuration file <scripts/secondary_discovery_server_configuration_file.xml>`

Following the previous configuration, build a simple system with a talker and a listener.

.. code-block:: console

    export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=discovery_server_configuration_file.xml
    ros2 daemon stop
    ros2 daemon start

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener --ros-args --remap __node:=listener

.. code-block:: console

    export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="127.0.0.1:11811"
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --remap __node:=talker

Continue using the ROS 2 CLI with ``--no-daemon`` option with the new configuration.
New nodes will connect with the existing Server and will know every topic.
Exporting ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` is not needed as the remote server has been configured by the XML configuration file.

.. code-block:: console

    export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=secondary_discovery_server_configuration_file.xml
    ros2 topic list --no-daemon
    ros2 node info /talker --no-daemon
    ros2 topic info /chatter --no-daemon
    ros2 topic echo /chatter --no-daemon



Compare Fast DDS Discovery Server with Simple Discovery Protocol
----------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compare executing nodes using the Simple Discovery Protocol (the default DDS mechanism for distributed discovery) or the discovery server, two scripts that execute a talker and many listeners and analyze the network traffic during this time are provided.
For this experiment, ``tshark`` is required to be installed on your system.
The configuration file is mandatory in order to avoid using intraprocess mode.

.. note::

    These scripts require a discovery server closure feature that is only available from versions newer than the version provided in ROS 2 Foxy.
    In order to use this functionality, compile ROS 2 with Fast DDS v2.1.0 or higher.

These scripts' features are references for advanced purposes and their study is left to the user.

* :download:`bash network traffic generator <scripts/generate_discovery_packages.bash>`

* :download:`python3 graph generator <scripts/discovery_packets.py>`

* :download:`XML configuration <scripts/no_intraprocess_configuration.xml>`

Run the bash script with the path to ``setup.bash`` file to source ROS 2 as an argument.
This will generate the traffic trace for simple discovery.
Execute the same script with second argument ``SERVER``.
It will generate the trace for using the discovery server.

.. note::

    Depending on your configuration of ``tcpdump``, this script may require ``sudo`` privileges to read traffic across your network device.

After both executions are done, run the Python script to generate a graph similar to the one below.

.. code-block:: console

    $ export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE="no_intraprocess_configuration.xml"
    $ sudo bash generate_discovery_packages.bash ~/ros2_foxy/install/local_setup.bash
    $ sudo bash generate_discovery_packages.bash ~/ros2_foxy/install/local_setup.bash SERVER
    $ python3 discovery_packets.py

.. image:: figures/discovery_packets.svg
    :align: center

This graph is the result of a specific run of the experiment.
The reader can execute the scripts and generate their own results for comparison.
It can easily be seen that network traffic is reduced when using discovery service.

The reduction in traffic is a result of avoiding every node announcing itself and waiting a response from every other node on the network.
This creates a huge amount of traffic in large architectures.
The reduction from this method increases with the number of nodes, making this architecture more scalable than the Simple Discovery Protocol approach.

The new Fast DDS Discovery Server v2 is available since *Fast DDS* v2.0.2, replacing the old discovery server.
In this new version, those nodes that do not share topics will automatically not discover each other, saving the whole discovery data required to connect them and their endpoints.
The experiment above does not show this case, but even so the massive reduction in traffic can be appreciated due to the hidden infrastructure topics of ROS 2 nodes.
