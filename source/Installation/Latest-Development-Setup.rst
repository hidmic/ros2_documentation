Installing the Latest ROS 2 Development
=======================================

If you plan to contribute directly to the latest ROS 2 development, you can install ROS 2 by building it from source.
This will give you the latest bug fixes and features.

.. note::

   The latest development does not go through the same rigorous testing as releases and is not recommended if you are looking for a stable version of ROS 2.
   Instead, choose a `ROS distribution <../Installation>` that has already been released.

Follow the links below for the latest setup instructions for your platform:

* :ref:`Linux <linux-latest>`
* :ref:`OS X <osx-latest>`
* :ref:`Windows <windows-latest>`

For keeping your source code up-to-date, see `Maintaining a Source Checkout <Maintaining-a-Source-Checkout>`.
