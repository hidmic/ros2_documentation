Debian packages for ROS 2 Rolling Ridley are currently available for Ubuntu Focal.
The Rolling Ridley distribution will change target platforms from time to time as new platforms are selected for development.
The target platforms are defined in `REP 2000 <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/blob/master/rep-2000.rst>`__
Most people will want to use a stable ROS distribution.

Install ROS 2 packages
----------------------

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-rolling-desktop

ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools.
No GUI tools.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-rolling-ros-base

Environment setup
-----------------

Sourcing the setup script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash

Install argcomplete (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS 2 command line tools use argcomplete to autocompletion.
So if you want autocompletion, installing argcomplete is necessary.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install -y python3-pip
   pip3 install -U argcomplete

Try some examples
-----------------

If you installed ``ros-rolling-desktop`` above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ ``talker``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python ``listener``\ :

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!

Next steps after installing
---------------------------
Continue with the `tutorials and demos </Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Using the ROS 1 bridge
----------------------
The ROS 1 bridge can connect topics from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and vice-versa. See the dedicated `documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README.md>`__ on how to build and use the ROS 1 bridge.

Additional RMW implementations (optional)
-----------------------------------------
The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Cyclone DDS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the `guide <../Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found `here <../Guides/Installation-Troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

If you need to uninstall ROS 2 or switch to a source-based install once you
have already installed from binaries, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt remove ros-rolling-* && sudo apt autoremove
