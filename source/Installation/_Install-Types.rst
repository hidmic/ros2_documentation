Which install should you choose?
--------------------------------

Installing from binary packages or from source will both result in a fully-functional and usable ROS 2 install.
Differences between the options only depend on what you plan to do with ROS 2.

**Binary packages** are for general use.
They will give you an already-built, unalterable (or highly-difficult-to-alter) install of ROS 2.
This is great for people who want to dive in and start using ROS 2 as-is, right away.

Linux users have two further options:

- Debian packages, which updates after every handful of improvements are made.
- The "fat" archive, which updates nightly (so it includes improvements made day-to-day).

 ..  why would someone choose one over the other?

**Building from source** is meant for developers looking to alter or explicitly omit parts of ROS 2's base.
