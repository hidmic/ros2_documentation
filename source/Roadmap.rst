This page describes planned work for ROS 2.
The set of planned features and development efforts should provide insight into the overall direction of ROS 2.
If you would like to see other features on the roadmap, then please get in touch with us at info@openrobotics.org.

Quarterly Roadmap
-----------------

**Product Readiness** is the current focus topic for ROS 2.
Over the next two quarters we will concentrate development efforts on topics that make ROS 2 more suitable for use in production scenarios.
This includes improving the out-of-box experience for common use cases, documentation improvements, and addressing disparities between ROS 1 and ROS 2.

## 2020 Q3(Jul - Sep)

* **Transport Documentation and Configurations**: Describe and document the
  ROS 2 transport system.
  Provide default configurations for common uses cases along with documentation.

## 2020 Q4(Oct - Dec)

* **Performance Improvements**: Analyze ``rcl*-level`` performance and resource usage.
  Develop a strategy to improve performance and reduce resource usage based on data from the analysis.

* **Launch**: Address current shortcoming in launch, and improve launch testing.

* **Documentation Infrastructure**: Develop package-level documentation generation infrastructure, deploy documentation, and consolidate existing documentation.

Planned releases
